### Bugs

##### Solved bugs

- When I copied and pasted my index.html head onto my success page i'd neglected to copy a closing head tag and also part of the code in the stylesheet link which resulted in my css not being linked to my success page.
- This issue was resolved after checking the code and amending the missing attributes.
